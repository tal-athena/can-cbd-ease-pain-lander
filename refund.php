                          VerifiedCBD.com: VerifiedCBD strives to keep you totally fulfilled and gratified, which is why we offer a 30-day, money back guarantee. If at any point you decide it’s not the most nutritious, delicious superfood mix on the planet, remember you are protected by the highest standard 100% money-back guarantee. Just send us the empty bottle and we’ll refund you to the last penny, no questions asked. If after 30 days of use, you are unhappy and would like a refund, here’s exactly what to do:
                           <br><br>
                          - Contact the VerifiedCBD team by calling +1 800-454-0472 Monday through Friday between the hours of 10:00am and 4:00pm Eastern Standard Time. We will gladly provide you with our return address, so as not to waste any materials, and a return confirmation number. This is an easy and effortless process.<br><br>
                          - Return the empty canister, the VerifiedCBD invoice that received, and the confirmation number you have been assigned.
  <br /><br>
  						  - ​It is your obligation to pay the return postage, and we do recommend you opt for tracking and confirmation numbers for verification and efficiency purposes. Note: We must receive the canister within 30 days from the date of original purchase for the refund to be valid.
<br/><br/>
						  - ​We will refund your entire order, excluding shipping costs, as long as all bottles purchased are returned.
​<br/><br/>
						  - We don't allow resale of VerifiedCBD products, so bottles will be refunded only after sufficient time has passed for a single customer to consume VerifiedCBD as directed.
​<br/><br/>						  
						  These guidelines were created to keep you satisfied, while at the same time ensuring we can continue to provide a quality product to other happy customers for years to come. Returning VerifiedCBD without complying with our policy will unfortunately deem your transaction non-refundable.
​<br/><br/>
						  After complying with the steps above, please allow adequate time for shipping, quality control, and communication with credit card companies and banks as you patiently await your refund.			</p>
